# ARL-unbiased-Xn-control-chart
This R code implements ARL-unbiased Xn control charts for monitoring M/Ek/1 queueing systems. It provides functions to compute ARL with and without randomization, allowing for precise control limit determination and detection of the randomization probabilities in queueing systems. The code also includes interactive plotting via Shiny
